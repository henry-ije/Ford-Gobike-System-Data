## Summary of Findings

> The average duration time is 510 secs and the youngest and oldest rider are 18 years and 141 years respectively. Duration time is skewed to the right with most riders in their 20's and 30's. Most trips happened on thursday and tuesday while saturday and sundays had the lowest trips. Although Saturday and Sunday had the highest duration of trips. This can be because some riders wanted to rest while those that rode, did since their was enough tiem, its the weekend. Most rides were taken with the early hours of 8 and 9 in the morning and 5 and 6 in the evening. This is the time when most people go to work and most people close at work. Only subscribers were involved in bike sharing while customers had the highest duration.Males are also common riders compared to females and other genders. From analysis, it is also discovered that there are more subscribers than customers.  


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I focus on just the distribution of duration, the relationship between day of the week and number of rides and what gender has the longest trip duration with respect to the user type. The plots were conducted using the plot, seaborn and barplot function.
